## Change variable for private and public keys

Go to control panel, settings , system properties and environment variables. The access key and secret key can be put in the user variable whearas the path can be put in the System variales . click new to creake new user variables and edit to edit your path in system variables

It should look something like this.

```
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID       pasteaccesskeyhere
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY   pastesecretkeyhere
```

In system variables, path
```
C:\terraform
```

Make a new directory next to your ansible directory for convenience, in my case Tech201_IaC/terraform.

then you can check that terrform is active there.
```
terraform --version
```
The main.tf file needs to be written and put in this folder.

After it has been written and saved and gitbash reopened in admin mode. The following commands can be used to initialise,  plan and then apply the deployement of ec2 instances.

```
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```
When we are done, we can used the following to terminate.
```
terraform destroy
```
