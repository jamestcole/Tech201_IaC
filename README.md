## Configuration management

This ConfigMgmt element focuses on inventorying existing IT assets. You should track all the assets relevant to your IT operations and application development environment. Then, the metadata of these systems should be stored in one central ConfigMgmt repository. 

You can now benchmark the apps, tools, and physical assets according to functional needs. For applications in the pipeline, benchmarking is done by running them in their test environment. 


Version control is the primary element of configuration management workflow. You can use any system like Git to track specification data of apps, tools, software, and physical assets. The pipeline version control system software helps roll back to the previously known exemplary configuration if an update causes any issues.
